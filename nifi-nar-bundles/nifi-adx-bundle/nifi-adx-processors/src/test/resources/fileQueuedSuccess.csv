As the front started to cross the Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia Appalachians during the morning of January 1st, a low pressure system formed on the triple point of the occluded front in northeastern Virginia around 7 a.m. EST on January 1st.

However, much needed precipitation during the latter half of the month, mainly in some form of winter precipitation, allowed for these areas to improve to just severe conditions (D2). This also allowed for an improvement to areas farther south that were in D2 drought conditions during the month of December. The winter storm from the 12th through the 14th provided much needed precipitation to improve these areas to D1 or less. |The drought has been ongoing for over a year now, which continues the water worries over many communities. Lake levels remain at or near record lows, although the recent beneficial moisture has helped somewhat. Many boat docks and ramps remained on dry ground, but lakes are showing some improvement, rising slowly during the last half of the month. Even at low levels, most lakes are still considered at safe levels for everyday living and water rationing has been kept to a minimum.|The agriculture industry continued to be hit hard by the drought. Although many farmers are beginning the year much better than they did last year due to the recent precipitation, many are fighting to save their 2007 crops. The recent precipitation has helped the top 12 inches of the soil, but the soil below this remains very dry. Additional precipitation will help crops that were planted during the fall, such as winter wheat. The crop damage for the area was estimated at 750 thousand dollars.",,"{

The first high wind event occurred during the afternoon and evening hours of the 5th as the upper level support was peaking. High winds were realized in many locations despite the fact that this peak occurred during the diurnally least favored time for Santa Ana winds. Wind gusts reached 75 mph at Fremont Canyon, 64 mph at Rancho Cucamonga, 63 mph at El Cariso, 59 mph at Rialto, 57 mph at Case Springs, 55 mph at Ontario. Winds were sustained 55 mph at Rancho Cucamonga, 52 mph at Fremont Canyon, and 40 mph at Ontario. Damaged or downed power poles were reported in Nuevo, Yucaipa, and Perris, while widespread damage to trees or tree limbs was reported in many other areas. Blowing dust reduced visibility to near zero along interstate 215 and the Ramona Expressway. Elsewhere, high winds in the San Bernardino Mountains near Rim Forest forced vehicles to slide across and off icy stretches of highway 18. Large trees fell onto homes and cars in the Lake Arrowhead area. Small, wind-driven wildfires were reported along interstate 15 near Mormon Rocks and the Cajon Pass. |The second high wind event occurred during the early morning hours of the 7th and the 8th. Wind gusts measured 84 mph at Fremont Canyon and 62 mph at Rialto. Sustained winds at these locations measured 51 mph and 45 mph respectively. The winds caused more damage to trees, flipped over a semi, and left numerous residents without power.|As is typical of most Santa Ana events, Fremont Canyon experienced the worst of the winds. Between the 5th and the 7th, Fremont Canyon RAWS measured 24 wind gusts of 60 mph or greater, 6 wind gusts of 70 mph or greater, and 2 wind gusts in excess of 80 mph.",,"{

The first high wind event occurred during the afternoon and evening hours of the 5th as the upper level support was peaking.

Accumulations were light, all reported amounts were less than one inch. But the combination of the snow melting and then water freezing on road surfaces plus the first snow event of the season (for some) led to many traffic accidents, especially in the Lehigh Valley and particularly in Northampton County. |Westbound Interstate 78 had just one lane opened because of several crashes between the New Jersey and Lehigh County lines. A van spun out of control on the icy roadway and struck a concrete barrier in Lower Saucon Township (Northampton County), closing the right lane for about an hour. One person in the van suffered a minor injury. All lanes were reopened by 11 a.m. EST. One vehicle rolled over on U.S. Route 22 in Palmer Township (Northampton County). Westbound traffic was disrupted until nearly Noon EST. A 40-year-old male suffered minor injuries. A woman was seriously injured when she lost control of her sport utility vehicle on northbound Pennsylvania State Route 33 in Bethlehem Township (Northampton County) and rolled the vehicle on its roof. In Lehigh County, officials reported two accidents involving buses around 9 a.m. EST, both in Washington Township. One, at Old Mill and Main Streets, involved a school bus and another vehicle. The children on board were taken to the hospital as a precaution. The second accident, at Pennsylvania State Route 873 and Oakland Road, involved a LANTA bus carrying 15 passengers. No injuries were reported in either accident. |In the Poconos, several accidents occurred on the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Accidents were also reported in Carbon County in Lehighton Borough and Franklin Township. In Monroe County, a school bus accident occurred at the intersection of Pennsylvania State Routes 423 and 196 in Coolbaugh Township. A 52-year-old woman could not stop her vehicle in time to avoid the stopped school bus at the intersection.

The temperature at 500mb in the low pressure center was as low as -42C over Oregon on the 11th but the air over Central California eventually lowered to -36C by the 12th. With such a cold air pool aloft, continued cold air advection from the northerly flow kept particularly dry, frigid air in the Central and Southern San Joaquin Valley (and much of the state) from late on the 11th through the 18th of the month with little moderation. Furthermore, high pressure did not build quickly behind the frontal passage aloft but rather the cold-core low lingered. This resulted in continued upper air mixing and did not set strong low-level temperature inversions utilized by growers for freeze mitigation efforts. The low pressure aloft remained an influence for the mornings of the 12th, 13th, and 14th. For the agricultural districts, minimum temperatures in the Valley dropped to 15-17 degrees F. in the very coldest locations. Within the agricultural citrus belts, minimum temperatures ranged consistently from 19 to 24 degrees. Not only were the typical temperature inversions not readily available for freeze mitigation due to mixing from the upper low pressure aloft, but the air in the lower levels of the Central and South San Joaquin Valley remained abnormally dry for a longer period of time. The frontal passage was dry and minimal moisture persisted on the Valley floor from the much below normal winter precipitation (only December had close to seasonal rainfall with October, November, and January relatively dry). No moderation of the lower atmosphere occurred over time due to persistent low dew points (minimal surface moisture evaporation for fog formation). With no typical moderation over time by increased dew points or fog, the coldest morning within a 5-day period from the 12th through the 16th varied by location across the Valley rather than time. Fresno had its coldest morning on the 13th with a low of 23 degree F., Bakersfield dropped to 23F on the 14th, and Merced and Hanford had their lowest minimums of 19F on the 15th. Temperature durations of 14 hours below 32F, 12 hours below 28F, and even 6-10 hours below 26F on several mornings resulted in devastating damage to area citrus. Preliminary estimates of crop losses were between 50% and 70% of fruit remaining on trees (an estimated 30% of the crop had been harvested prior to the freeze.) Crop damage was estimated at almost $1.3 billion of California's annual $32 billion agricultural production with nearly $709 million in the Interior Central California ag area. The January 2007 Freeze for Central California comes in another 8-year interval behind the citrus-devastating freezes of December 1990 and December 1998. The December 1990 Freeze undoubtedly was the most devastating of these economic disasters due to the loss of citrus trees and not just total loss of the fruit. The dollar-loss for the January 2007 Freeze, being unadjusted for inflation, will be higher than the December 1998 Freeze (by about $100 million). However, the length of the coldest days in the 1998 event along with its earlier occurrence in the year makes it arguably the second worst among these events. As summarized by a grower, the December 1998 freeze took 85% of the fruit with 85% of the fruit still unharvested on the trees. The January 2007 freeze took 70% of approximately 70% of the fruit unharvested.|Much below normal minimum temperatures also resulted in numerous instances of frozen pipes, damage to water delivery systems, and subsequent further loss to nurseries and growers depending on water for assistance in the freeze fight. At least two municipalities, Earlimart (Tulare County) and Frazier Park (Kern County), had some short-term unavailability of drinking water due to minor damage from the freezing cold. Although temperatures began to show some moderation by the morning of the 17th, nights with sub-freezing temperatures continued across the agricultural areas through the morning of the 24th. Fresno (Fresno County) had 19 consecutive days with minimum temperatures of 32 degrees or lower, only 1 day less than the all-time record. One Kern County citrus grower commented toward the end of the event that his crews had been in a frost-fight mode for over 40 days (given some mid-month frost concerns in December). Due to the loss of the citurs crop, the large, unmeasureable effect of the January 2007 Freeze is the economic loss to tens of thousands of workers out of jobs in the Central and South San Joaquin Valley besides the loss to production agriculture. The impact to the Valley economy is in the billions of dollars. One fatality occurred in Bakersfield (Kern County) by the morning of the 17th despite may cities opening warming shelters for the homeless...see other another January 2007 Stormdata episode for details.",,"{

The temperature at 500mb in the low pressure center was as low as -42C over Oregon on the 11th but the air over Central California eventually lowered to -36C by the 12th. With such a cold air pool aloft, continued cold air advection from the northerly flow kept particularly dry, frigid air in the Central and Southern San Joaquin Valley (and much of the state) from late on the 11th through the 18th of the month with little moderation. Furthermore, high pressure did not build quickly behind the frontal passage aloft but rather the cold-core low lingered. This resulted in continued upper air mixing and did not set strong low-level temperature inversions utilized by growers for freeze mitigation efforts. The low pressure aloft remained an influence for the mornings of the 12th, 13th, and 14th. For the agricultural districts, minimum temperatures in the Valley dropped to 15-17 degrees F. in the very coldest locations. Within the agricultural citrus belts, minimum temperatures ranged consistently from 19 to 24 degrees. Not only were the typical temperature inversions not readily available for freeze mitigation due to mixing from the upper low pressure aloft, but the air in the lower levels of the Central and South San Joaquin Valley remained abnormally dry for a longer period of time. The frontal passage was dry and minimal moisture persisted on the Valley floor from the much below normal winter precipitation (only December had close to seasonal rainfall with October, November, and January relatively dry). No moderation of the lower atmosphere occurred over time due to persistent low dew points (minimal surface moisture evaporation for fog formation). With no typical moderation over time by increased dew points or fog, the coldest morning within a 5-day period from the 12th through the 16th varied by location across the Valley rather than time. Fresno had its coldest morning on the 13th with a low of 23 degree F., Bakersfield dropped to 23F on the 14th, and Merced and Hanford had their lowest minimums of 19F on the 15th. Temperature durations of 14 hours below 32F, 12 hours below 28F, and even 6-10 hours below 26F on several mornings resulted in devastating damage to area citrus. Preliminary estimates of crop losses were between 50% and 70% of fruit remaining on trees (an estimated 30% of the crop had been harvested prior to the freeze.) Crop damage was estimated at almost $1.3 billion of California's annual $32 billion agricultural production with nearly $709 million in the Interior Central California ag area. The January 2007 Freeze for Central California comes in another 8-year interval behind the citrus-devastating freezes of December 1990 and December 1998. The December 1990 Freeze undoubtedly was the most devastating of these economic disasters due to the loss of citrus trees and not just total loss of the fruit. The dollar-loss for the January 2007 Freeze, being unadjusted for inflation, will be higher than the December 1998 Freeze (by about $100 million). However, the length of the coldest days in the 1998 event along with its earlier occurrence in the year makes it arguably the second worst among these events. As summarized by a grower, the December 1998 freeze took 85% of the fruit with 85% of the fruit still unharvested on the trees. The January 2007 freeze took 70% of approximately 70% of the fruit unharvested.|Much below normal minimum temperatures also resulted in numerous instances of frozen pipes, damage to water delivery systems, and subsequent further loss to nurseries and growers depending on water for assistance in the freeze fight. At least two municipalities, Earlimart (Tulare County) and Frazier Park (Kern County), had some short-term unavailability of drinking water due to minor damage from the freezing cold. Although temperatures began to show some moderation by the morning of the 17th, nights with sub-freezing temperatures continued across the agricultural areas through the morning of the 24th. Fresno (Fresno County) had 19 consecutive days with minimum temperatures of 32 degrees or lower, only 1 day less than the all-time record. One Kern County citrus grower commented toward the end of the event that his crews had been in a frost-fight mode for over 40 days (given some mid-month frost concerns in December). Due to the loss of the citurs crop, the large, unmeasureable effect of the January 2007 Freeze is the economic loss to tens of thousands of workers out of jobs in the Central and South San Joaquin Valley besides the loss to production agriculture. The impact to the Valley economy is in the billions of dollars.

Numerous long standing records were broken as temperatures dipped into the 20s and 30s along the coast, the teens in the valleys, the single digits to below zero in the mountains, and into the single digits to teens in the deserts. Except for right along the immediate coastline, the freeze lasted for up to a week or longer. Local farmers were hit the hardest by the freeze. Crop damage was estimated at $114.7 million in San Diego County, $86 million in Riverside County, and 11.1 million in San Bernardino County. All three of these counties were eventually declared Disaster Areas. Plumbing pipes froze and burst in many valley, mountain, and desert locations. For example, more than $600,000 in damage from broken pipes was reported just in the San Bernardino County mountains and deserts. The famed golf courses of the Palm Springs area didn't escape the freeze either. It will cost an estimated $20,000 just to repair one golf course in Indian Wells alone.|At the onset of the freeze, snow was reported in the valleys of San Bernardino, Riverside, and San Diego Counties at elevations as low as 500 ft. Gusty winds at times made it feel much colder. During the freeze, the air temperature dropped to 7 degrees below zero at Fawnskin, 2 degrees below zero at Big Bear Lake and Wrightwood, 5 degrees in the high desert city of Hesperia, 6 degrees at Mount Laguna in San Diego County, 8 degrees in Apple Valley, 10 degrees at the Anza-Borrego Valley Airport, 11 degrees at Idyllwild, 12 degrees near the Mexico border at Campo, 13 degrees at the top of the Palm Springs Tramway, 16 degrees at Ramona, Pine Cove, Angelus Oaks, Potrero, and Twentynine Palms, 18 degrees at Thermal, Julian, and Palomar, 19 degrees at Hemet and Moreno Valley, and 20 degrees at Chino and Camp Pendleton.

Central Kansas was spared the brunt of this winter storm with most of that part of Kansas seeing a quarter to three-quarters of an inch of sleet. After the storm was over, temperatures dropped into the single digits above zero. This caused the sleet to solidify into a sheet of solid white ice that resembled very dense foam.

The hardest hit areas with freezing rain were Atoka, Bryan, Coal, Cotton, Hughes, Seminole, and Johnston counties. The wintry precipitation caused numerous traffic accidents with numerous indirect injuries and 14 indirect fatalities. Many trees and powers lines were downed with thousands of residents without power, mainly over southern and eastern Oklahoma. The severe cold that accompanied this storm also allowed for water main breaks in Clinton and Lawton. Other damage included school gymnasium roofs collapsed in Del City, Newcastle, two awnings collasped in Allen and Ada, and four greenhouse roofs collasped in McClain county. Also, the prolonged period of wintry precipitation closed airports, schools, malls, and other places of business. The slick and hazardous roads caused many schools to remained closed for several days after the winter precipitation had ended.",,"{

A strong upper level low pressure system moved into the southern Rockies and several disturbances translated across the Southern Plains bringing periods of heavy sleet and freezing rain to the region. The initial precipitation began around daybreak on the 12th and the final round occurred on the 14th. |A devastating swath of one to three inch ice amounts fell in an estimated 60 to 80 mile wide band from roughly Atoka to McAlester to Muskogee to Grove.  An estimated 120,000 electric customers were without power due to downed power poles and power lines within this swath, some of which were without power for more than two weeks. West of the heavy ice, one to three inches of sleet occurred with lesser amounts of freezing rain, generally between 1/4 to 1/2 inch.  The worst damage to the public infrastructure from the storm in eastern Oklahoma occurred in Muskogee County ($10.5 million), Pittsburg County ($7.5 million), McIntosh County ($6 million), Haskell County ($5 million), Delaware County ($3 million), Wagoner County ($2 million), Mayes County ($1.5 million), and Cherokee County ($1 million).",,"{

Power outages and catastrophic tree damage were the main impacts resulting from this historic event.  Power outages occurred for over three weeks in many areas.  Several indirect fatalities due to the extreme elements were documented.  Carbon monoxide poisoning occurred within a few homes as gas generators were being used in garages, which allowed for dangerous levels of carbon monoxide to seep into houses.","Ice accumulations caused extensive damage to power lines, trees, and a few structures across mainly northern Christian County.  Four structure fires occurred as a result of power problems.

The severe cold that accompanied this storm also allowed for water main breaks in Clinton and Lawton. Other damage included school gymnasium roofs collapsed in Del City, Newcastle, two awnings collasped in Allen and Ada, and four greenhouse roofs collasped in McClain county. Also, the prolonged period of wintry precipitation closed airports, schools, malls, and other places of business.

The initial precipitation began around daybreak on the 12th and the final round occurred on the 14th. |A devastating swath of one to three inch ice amounts fell in an estimated 60 to 80 mile wide band from roughly Atoka to McAlester to Muskogee to Grove.  An estimated 120,000 electric customers were without power due to downed power poles and power lines within this swath, some of which were without power for more than two weeks. West of the heavy ice, one to three inches of sleet occurred with lesser amounts of freezing rain, generally between 1/4 to 1/2 inch.  The worst damage to the public infrastructure from the storm in eastern Oklahoma occurred in Muskogee County ($10.5 million), Pittsburg County ($7.5 million), McIntosh County ($6 million), Haskell County ($5 million), Delaware County ($3 million), Wagoner County ($2 million), Mayes County ($1.5 million), and Cherokee County ($1 million).",,"{

Over 150,000 customers were without power at one time during the ice storm. Many were without power for 2 days, and some for over 3 days. Several senior homes lost power and 200 residents had to be evacuated from one of them. Most of the damage and associated power outages occurred between M59 and I94. Although roads were just warm enough to remain mainly wet, patchy slick spots and downed tree debris made traveling very hazardous. Along and just north of the I-69 corridor, a mixture of freezing rain, sleet, and snow fell, where reports confirmed up to 5 inches of snow and one tenth of an inch of ice. Mostly all snow fell across the Tri-Cities and Thumb, where 4 to 6 inches of snow accumulated across portions of these areas. Although many schools were already closed to observe Martin Luther King Jr Day, nearly all of the other schools in Southeast Michigan closed on Monday due to the storm, with the exception of Monroe county schools, where precipitation fell as mostly rain. Over 50 Detroit metro area schools remained closed on Tuesday due to power outages. Numerous car accidents occurred across the affected areas. Several vehicles were destroyed by large trees that fell under the extra weight of the ice and there were at least two incidents of trees falling onto moving vehicles. Most injuries (all indirect) were minor. Total property damage was roughly estimated in excess of $2M. This included damage to vehicles, homes, businesses, and electrical poles and transformers. Downed power lines also sparked several garage fires. In addition, many businesses in the hardest hit areas reported losses due to the extended power outages.","A local newspaper included pictures of trees down in Hudson, crushing at least one vehicle.

Cold arctic air, drawn from the north, clashed with warm moist air from the Gulf to create a favorable setup for all types of winter precipitation across Southeast Michigan. An ice storm ensued from I-69 south to I-94. Widespread ice accumulations of a quarter to a half inch brought down numerous trees, power poles and power lines. Over 150,000 customers were without power at one time during the ice storm. Many were without power for 2 days, and some for over 3 days. Several senior homes lost power and 200 residents had to be evacuated from one of them. Most of the damage and associated power outages occurred between M59 and I94. Although roads were just warm enough to remain mainly wet, patchy slick spots and downed tree debris made traveling very hazardous. Along and just north of the I-69 corridor, a mixture of freezing rain, sleet, and snow fell, where reports confirmed up to 5 inches of snow and one tenth of an inch of ice. Mostly all snow fell across the Tri-Cities and Thumb, where 4 to 6 inches of snow accumulated across portions of these areas. Although many schools were already closed to observe Martin Luther King Jr Day, nearly all of the other schools in Southeast Michigan closed on Monday due to the storm, with the exception of Monroe county schools, where precipitation fell as mostly rain. Over 50 Detroit metro area schools remained closed on Tuesday due to power outages. Numerous car accidents occurred across the affected areas. Several vehicles were destroyed by large trees that fell under the extra weight of the ice and there were at least two incidents of trees falling onto moving vehicles. Most injuries (all indirect) were minor. Total property damage was roughly estimated in excess of $2M. This included damage to vehicles, homes, businesses, and electrical poles and transformers.

The serious problems were associated with coatings of freezing rain and drizzle that varied from one-half inch to three-quarters of an inch in thickness.  In many locations, schools and businesses and local offices were already closed on January 15 due to the Martin Luther King Holiday and simply did not re-open until Wednesday, January 16, or Thursday, January 17.  Hundreds of accidents were reported on interstate highways as well as city and rural roads, causing additional closures and problems.

At the same time, an upper level disturbance began to approach South Texas from the southwest.  Light precipitation from the upper level system began falling through the cold air and freezing over the northwest counties first.  With time, the event spread to the west and southeast, including all but the extreme southern tier of counties, by January 16.  Spotty 1 to 2 inch snowfalls were common over the Hill Country and Edwards Plateau.  The serious problems were associated with coatings of freezing rain and drizzle that varied from one-half inch to three-quarters of an inch in thickness.  In many locations, schools and businesses and local offices were already closed on January 15 due to the Martin Luther King Holiday and simply did not re-open until Wednesday, January 16, or Thursday, January 17.  Hundreds of accidents were reported on interstate highways as well as city and rural roads, causing additional closures and problems.  Most area schools were closed on January 16 as a result of the storm.","Sleet, freezing rain and drizzle began near 3 am on the morning of January 15.  By mid morning, roads were closed across the county and remained closed through the following day.  Schools, offices and businesses shut down early on January 15 and also remained closed the next day.  Included in the major road closures were US277 and US90 for part of January 15 and all the next day.","{

A moist westerly flow was primed and even though it was only marginally cold enough, the moisture in lower levels was enough to set off the activity, which primarily focused on Oswego county for much of Friday midday and afternoon before settling southward as winds veered. Rates up to two inches per hour were noted Friday afternoon along with several reports of thunder. The Lake Erie activity was more spread out and multiple banded but did pile up on some of the ridges and ski areas. Total amounts were as much as 12-18 over much of Oswego County.|Off Lake Erie, specific snowfall reports included: 12 inches at Ellicottville and 10 inches at South Dayton.  Off Lake Ontario, snowfall reports included: 17 inches at Constantia, 14 inches at Fulton, 13 inches at West Monroe and 9 inches as Parish.",,"{
